# Laravel-Elasticsearch

An easy way to use the [official Elastic Search client](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php) in your Laravel or Lumen applications.

## ⚠️ This Package Is Abandoned
Due to several factors, including the fact that I no longer use ES,
I have ceased development on this package.

You are free to continue using it, but be aware that any issues or PRs
you submit (including working with recent versions of Laravel), or any
feature requests you have, will likely be ignored.

If you want to use a maintained version of this package, you can:
- [create a new fork](https://github.com/cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch/fork)
- [use an existing fork](https://github.com/cviebrock/laravel-elasticsearch/forks)
- migrate to the package that has taken over development: **[mailerlite/laravel-elasticsearch](https://github.com/mailerlite/laravel-elasticsearch)**
